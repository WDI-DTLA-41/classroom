## Repo Structure and Use

#### What's in here?



#### What can I do?

As a student, you have **pull** permissions on this repository.
You should copy ("clone") the repo to your computer.

We will go over this process (or "workflow") in class.

The biggest rule is this: do not work in any folders (or make changes to any
folders) in the class repository. Copy files into your working folder. That way
the instructors won't erase or overwrite any of your work!

#### What am I viewing here?

You are viewing the README.md file in the current directory. It is written in
[Markdown] [1] -- a plain text formatting syntax which emphasizes readability.
It is recommended that you always have a README.md in the root directory of
your GitHub project. For viewing and editing Markdown files on your
computer, try [MacDown] [2].
